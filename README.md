# OFX Currency Converter 

### Description

Overseas Foreign Exchange (OFX) online converter. This permits users to get spot quote details for converting 
from one currency to another. 

**Please note**: I have used NextJS, TypeScript, Storybook and SWR when demonstrating this application in order to show 
how I would code a versatile and enterprise ready application. For a simple application like this, I could have 
written this as a simple CRA using fetch/axios and this would have provided a simpler solution with less overhead but
in my mind would fail to show you a true world example.
 
### Prerequisites

Please ensure that the latest version of npm and yarn are installed 

### Installing

#### Install Dependencies 
```
yarn
```
### Start application in development mode
```
yarn dev
```

### Storybook
```
yarn storybook
```

### Build application
```
yarn build
```

### Start application
```
yarn start (ensure build has been done prior)
```

### Todo
- Given more time I would have provided a fetch mock test. Refer to https://www.leighhalliday.com/mock-fetch-jest
- Put sensitive information and end points in an env file.
- The Name, Email and Phone fields are not used. This would obviously be store and used in a real application
- Use the error messages supplied from API when the request fails
- Enhance UI look and feel of page
- Make phone input into a separate component
- Add more information on UI regarding minimum transfer amounts
- Add style components to ui and incorporate a better layout structure
- Make themes fully functional

### Issues
- Warnings on console
