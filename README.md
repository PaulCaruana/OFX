a .env.local file (which will we excluded from the repository) then add sensitive fields to it. Please do the following:

- Copy env to .env.local or .env*.local file.
- Add vendors API Keys to this file.

### Todo
- Enhance UI look and feel including about pages, contact us etc.
- Change eslint / prettier with semi-colons.

This will allow API key to be hidden and provide a cleaner solution.
- Add robust error handling
- Add page layout and navigation
- Add "please wait" metaphor when loading
- Add further jest tests
- Perform filtered search (I assume that production APIs would handle filtering and pagination) 
- Include pagination or virtual scrolling
